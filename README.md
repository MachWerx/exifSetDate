# exifSetDate
A simple python script to set the modification time of a file to the EXIF creation time.

This relies on the PIL python image library. If you don't already have PIL, you
can install it with the following command:

    sudo pip install Pillow

If you don't have pip, then look up how to install it on your system. For
MacOS, you can do the following:

    sudo easy_install pip
